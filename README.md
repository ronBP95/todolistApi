# todolistApi
Custom built Api

Api based on instructions from https://www.codementor.io/@olatundegaruba/nodejs-restful-apis-in-10-minutes-q0sgsfhbd

Instructions:
Api is currently working. Tested the GET route via Postman @ localhost:8000/tasks which returns an empty array because there are no
entries that are made at the start of the "to-do" app.

For adding entries, you can use Postman to switch to the body and select x-www-form-encoded and enter in the name for the key and
task for the value and your task entry should populate below.
